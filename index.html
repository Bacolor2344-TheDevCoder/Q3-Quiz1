	    		<td>Directed by Ivan Reitman, starring Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis as main characters</td>
	    		<td>"There aren't many movies better than Ghostbusters. This film expertly balances itself right between the horror genre and the comedy genre. The chemistry of the main three characters is undeniable, and when you throw in interesting side characters (such as Rick Moranis as Louis Tully), every scene is a delight to watch. The story is original, the effects are impressive and the jokes are funny - in short, Ghostbusters is a timeless classic." - cricketbat (IMDB) </td>

	    		<td>Directed by James Cameron, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as main characters</td>
	    		<td>"I have watched Titanic how many times I don't know. Everytime I watch it, I still cry, laugh, smile, and feel. The story flows with tension throughout the movie; two actors' acting and chemistry need applaud; Sinking ship is realistically filmed; 'My Heart Will Go On' is perfect fit for Jack and Roses' love story and is timeless as well. All the movie's factors are fully qualified. What more can I say? It is the masterpiece." - TaylorYee94 (IMDB)</td>

	    		<td>"..What I will say is that this film, more than just about any other I've seen, put me through so many different emotional states during its 132-minute runtime, and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent. Parts of this movie were hilarious. Parts were heartbreaking. Other parts were insanely suspenseful (I'm honestly not sure if I've felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad, way back in 2013)." - Jeremy_Urquhart (IMDB, review excerpt)</td>
